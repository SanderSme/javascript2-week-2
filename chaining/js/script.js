//One of the most powerful features of array methods is that
//hey can be chained. This means that you can immediately have
//array methods being called on the result of other array methods.
//Combining the array methods allows you to perform very complex
//operations with very little effort, the limitations typically
//being your own imagination.

//Basic example:
// const values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];

// const result = values
//   .filter(/* This filter first runs */)
//   .reduce(/* This reduce acts on the result of the filter */)
//   .map(/* This map acts on the result of the reduce above */);

//Practical examples:
//Example 1: calculating the discount of products in stock:
//we want to apply discount for some products for a sale, but only products where:
//-the price is 5 or higher (>= 5)
//-the products are in stock (inStock === true)
//We then need to store this discounted amount so it can be displayed at a later stage.
//We can do this in a two step process with chaining:
//filter the products that are equal to or above 5 as well as being in stock
//map out the filtered products while performing a calculation to get the discount and storing it as a value (discountedPrice).

//NOTE: The formula for calculating the discounted price is:
//discount = price - (discount percentage / 100) * price
// The discount percentage being applied
const DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE = 20;

const products = [
  { name: "Milk", price: 5.0, inStock: true },
  { name: "Cheese", price: 10.0, inStock: true },
  { name: "Bread", price: 8.0, inStock: false },
  { name: "Beans", price: 3.0, inStock: true },
  { name: "Eggs", price: 12.0, inStock: true },
  { name: "Rice", price: 4.0, inStock: false },
  { name: "Meat", price: 25, inStock: true },
  { name: "Coffee", price: 12.0, inStock: true },
  { name: "Tea", price: 8.0, inStock: false },
  { name: "Bottled Water", price: 4.0, inStock: false },
];

const discountedProducts = products
  .filter((product) => {
    if (product.inStock === true && product.price >= 5) {
      return true;
    }
  })

  .map((product) => {
    product.discountedPrice =
      product.price - (DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE / 100) * product.price;
    return product;
  });
console.log(discountedProducts);
// Returns:
// {name: 'Milk', price: 5, inStock: true, discountedPrice: 4}
// {name: 'Cheese', price: 10, inStock: true, discountedPrice: 8}
// {name: 'Eggs', price: 12, inStock: true, discountedPrice: 9.6}
// {name: 'Meat', price: 25, inStock: true, discountedPrice: 20}
// {name: 'Coffee', price: 12, inStock: true, discountedPrice: 9.6}

//Example 2:
//We have a list of students. We need to calculate the average so that we
//can analyse data. Each student has their own result in an array (results)
//that must first be calculated as average before we can get the class average.
//The students that are getting analysed must be:
//-at leat 30 years old
//-an online student

//We can achieve the above with a filter and reduce chain while also having a nested reduce:

//filter: We first filter out the students we need (age >= 30 and isOnline === true), which returns an array of only the students we need.
//reduce: We then reduce all of the studentâ€™s averages so that we can have one class average.
//a. reduce: We need to get the average of a student before we can calculate the class average. We, therefore, have a nested reduce inside the main reduce that loops through all of the studentâ€™s results to get an average.

const students = [
  { name: "Victoria", age: 19, isOnline: true, results: [80, 61, 66, 50, 91] },
  { name: "Theo", age: 32, isOnline: false, results: [57, 99, 96, 72, 96] },
  { name: "Markus", age: 54, isOnline: true, results: [50, 92, 70, 66, 90] },
  { name: "Aksel", age: 21, isOnline: true, results: [77, 86, 70, 71, 75] },
  { name: "Felix", age: 29, isOnline: false, results: [99, 76, 59, 74, 68] },
  { name: "Benjamin", age: 48, isOnline: true, results: [65, 85, 74, 83, 54] },
  { name: "Ulrik", age: 39, isOnline: true, results: [92, 72, 55, 69, 58] },
  { name: "Alma", age: 28, isOnline: false, results: [92, 91, 66, 77, 71] },
  { name: "July", age: 37, isOnline: true, results: [78, 70, 59, 76, 95] },
  { name: "Leo", age: 42, isOnline: true, results: [55, 64, 88, 88, 95] },
];

const result = students
  //get only the students >= 30 and that are online:
  .filter((student) => {
    if (student.age >= 30 && student.isOnline === true) {
      return true;
    }
  })
  //reduce all of the students averages to a class average:
  .reduce((classAverage, student, index, studentsArray) => {
    //reduce all of the students results to a single average:
    const studentsTotalMarks = student.results.reduce(
      (studentAverage, result, index, resultsArray) => {
        studentAverage += result / resultsArray.length;
        return studentAverage;
      },
      0
    );
    //add the average of the student to the class average:
    classAverage += studentsTotalMarks / studentsArray.length;
    return classAverage;
  }, 0);
console.log(result);
